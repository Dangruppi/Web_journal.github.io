  <h1>Our houseplants are an essential aspect of our decorating philosophy. We  chose our interior colors to match the 

houseplant green and we don't have much stuff on the walls. I am extremely proud of our bay window hanging display. I think 

it belongs on Pinterest. Maybe someday I will post it there myself. Kinda sounds like a whole big thing.</h1>
